			<h2>Spot Gorillas in Uganda</h2>
			<img src="images/adventures/gorilla.jpeg" class="left">
			<p>It’s very possible to get a smidge of primatologist Jane Goodall’s experience
			without making gorillas your life’s work. On Abercrombie & Kent’s 5-day Tailor-
			Made Uganda: Bwindi Impenetrable Forest journey, you’ll pick your adventure
			pleasure, whether you want to penetrate the lush-beyond-belief Bwindi
			“Impenetrable” Forest National Park in search of its resident tribes of gorillas, or
			tour the children’s wing at the local community hospital with A&K Philanthropy.
			When you see your first gorilla, remember it’s not King Kong: gorillas are typically
			sweet-tempered, even a bit bashful.</p>
